    Description: 
    PVP Chess is a dynamic chess game where players take turns starting with white. To begin the game, simply press the space bar. You can move your pieces by clicking on them, which highlights the valid squares they can move to. The program includes features such as checking for check, special moves like castling and en passant, and pawn promotion with a clickable drop-down menu for selecting the desired piece. Additionally, there are functions for detecting checkmate and stalemate, which lead to the end of the game. To start a new game, simply press the space bar again.
